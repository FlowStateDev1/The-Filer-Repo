The Filer - A simple Blazor application that allows basic text file manipulation using a RESTful Api.

To 'reset' the MockFiles folder, preserving the example and removing added files, be sure to utilize 
the terminal with dotnet commands (dotnet build, run, Ctrl-C). This properly exits the 
application and allows .Net to send the exiting signals to run the MockFolder's
clean up service.
