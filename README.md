The Filer - A simple Blazor application that allows basic text file manipulation using a RESTful Api.

(HTTPS Error Prevention)
Before running the application, run the command "dotnet dev-certs https --trust" within your terminal.
This is safe and is needed for your system to trust the HTTPS-Port certificate generated by .Net initally ran.

See (https://aka.ms/aspnet/https-trust-dev-cert) under the
"Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate" heading for more information.
 
(Folder Resest)
To 'reset' the MockFiles folder, preserving the examples and removing added files, be sure to utilize 
the terminal with dotnet commands (dotnet build, run, Ctrl-C). This properly exits the 
application and allows .Net to send the exiting signals to run the MockFolder's
clean up service.
