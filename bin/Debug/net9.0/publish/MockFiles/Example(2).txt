"Aqua Regia" - Sleep Token

Well, my love is an animal call
Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls
Between teeth on a broken jaw
Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw
And these days, I'm a circuit board
Integrated hardware you cannot afford
The perfect start to a perfect war
Putting down the roses, picking up the sword

Aqua Regia
Aqua Regia

Well, my past is a holy book
A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook
Between the pain and the way you look
I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook
And these days, I'm a picture frame
Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain
Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain
Out of Eden's vices running through my veins

Aqua Regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions, if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of

Oh, when I am done dancing to alarm bells
No wonder my ears are still ringing
And I am done fighting off change
No wonder my arms are still swinging

Aqua Regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions, if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of
